-   The version number counting rule of openEuler is changed from openEuler  _x.x_  to openEuler  _year_._month_. For example, openEuler 20.03 indicates that the version is released in March 2020.
-   The  [Python core team](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0373/#update)  has stopped maintaining Python 2 in January 2020. In 2020, openEuler 20.03 LTS fixes only the critical CVE of Python 2 and will reach the end of maintenance \(EOM\) on December 31, 2020. Please switch to Python 3 as soon as possible.
